            <div id="body_text"><p>The idea of war in the modern day is often misrepresented compared to what it truly is. Every person can know that war involves death and is “bad”, but how far does that understanding go? As most people have not experienced war first-hand, their preconceived idea of war has to come from somewhere, which is where the idea of media and news comes in. </p></div>

            <h2 id="quote">"The real is not only what can be reproduced, but what is always already reproduced: that is the hyperreal"</h2>
            <h2 id="quote">- Jean Baudrillard</h2>
