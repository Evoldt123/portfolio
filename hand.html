            <div id="body_text"><p>The idea of war in the modern day is often misrepresented compared to what it truly is. Every person can know that war involves death and is “bad”, but how far does that understanding go? As most people have not experienced war first-hand, their preconceived idea of war has to come from somewhere, which is where the idea of media and news comes in. </p></div>

            <h2 id="quote">"The real is not only what can be reproduced, but what is always already reproduced: that is the hyperreal"</h2>
            <h2 id="quote">- Jean Baudrillard</h2>

            <img src="hand_images\img_2.jpg">
            <div id="body_text"><p>The “hyperrealism” of modern day media regarding war means that since most people do not have first-hand experience with war, movies, games, and news headlines represent war more “realistically” in a society. In a way, the glorification of war becomes a bigger reality than actual war. </p></div>
            <div id="body_text"><p>The problem with this is that it takes away the significance of the tragedies in war, war crimes are becoming desensitized after people hear about them endless times. When people hear the numbers of tragedies in war, they become just that; numbers.</p></div>

            <div id="body_text"><p>These are just 5 of the 61000 civilians who have been acknowledged as dead. Acknowledged as a number on a count. Disgustingly enough, these 5 are the “lucky ones'' among the victims. These five people were noticed by the media because of their role in society and because they symbolize the losses that so many people feel. </p></div>
            <div id="body_text"><p>They deserve more than to be headlines on a news article, they deserve the dignity to be recognized as more than a symbol, they deserve to live the life of a regular human being, and as human beings. To the others among the sixty-one thousand people dead in just these conflicts, they deserve to be more than a number on a screen. They deserve the same as the rest of us.</p></div>
